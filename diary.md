# 9/8/20

Hopefully just a few pathing changes to make to get this working. Famous last words :).

Ok, produced Figure 1 Klein plots. Needed some cleaning up, though. Same experience with sFigure 2.

# 10/8/20

Installed `scImpute` with `remotes::install_github('Vivianstats/scImpute')` rather than through Bioconductor.

Ok, produced Figure 1 and Figure s9 as required.
